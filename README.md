## 👋 Hi, I’m @richardbarlian
### I like doing ML/AI projects
### A little bit more about me...
```python
class Richard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Richard"
        self.interest = "Python"
	self.email = "richard.barlian@gmail.com"
    def short_description(self):
        print("Thanks for dropping by, hope you find some of my repositories interesting.")

me = Richard()
me.short_description()
```
